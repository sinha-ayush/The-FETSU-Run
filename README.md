# The-FETSU-Run 

The Jadavpur University, Faculty of Engineering and Technology Students Union(F.E.T.S.U.) is known for it's events that complement the university's academic curriculum and augment the student's educational experience. Be it the redefinition of culture in Sanskriti(the annual cultural fest of JU) or showcasing the technical prowess in Srijan(the annual tech fest of JU), the F.E.T.S.U. family has always focused on the impact these events create on the development of society. It’s Events like these that not only show how critical the F.E.T.S.U. family has been to everyone around, but also why it’s of substantial importance, for us as a part of this family, to continue to be an exemplary custodian for this family’s altruistic legacy. This year we are adding a marathon, The FETSU Run, to our annual event list. Whether you are a seasoned jogger who wants to work towards a new goal or a novice runner who is inspired by a friend's accomplishment of winning a race, there are many personal reasons as to why you would want to run in a marathon, and here comes F.E.T.S.U. to the rescue.
